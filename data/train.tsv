Queen , President Universal Capital Management , Inc. 2601 Annand Drive , Suite 16 Wilmington , DE 19808 \ Re : Universal Capital Management , Inc. ( the " Company " ) \ File Number : 814 - 701 ( CIK 1308569 ) \ Dear Mr. Queen : \ We have reviewed the Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 filed on July 27 , 2011 ( the " Filing " ) on behalf of the Company relating to the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30 , 2011 . We also reviewed the Form 10-K filed on August 13 , 2010 ( the " 10-K " ) and certain information presented on the Company 's website . \ The staff notes that since July 29 , 2008 , the Company has filed nine ( 9 ) NT filings in connection with late filing of its required statutory financial statement reports . Substantially identical justification was provided with each NT form filed by the Company . In the interest of brevity , we have omitted the full cites and descriptions of those NT filings . \ Based on our review of the Filing , and in conjunction with the Company 's filing history and its website , we have the following comments : \ We have evaluated your response to Part III in the Filing and have found your reasons for the extension of time to be inconsistent with the use of Form 12b-25 . \ If the reason for the Company 's delay in filing is due to the inability of a person , other than the Company , to furnish any required opinion , report or certification , additional disclosure is required . In accordance with Rule 12b- 25(c ) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , a registrant is required to attach as an exhibit a statement signed by such person stating the specific reasons why such person is unable to furnish the required opinion , report or certification on or before the date such report must be filed . \ Form 12b-25 requires the Company to provide in " reasonable detail the reasons why the Forms could not be filed within the prescribed time period ( emphasis added ) . " The Filing provided the following response , in its entirety , to	<::::> We have evaluated your response to Part III in the Filing and have found your reasons for the extension of time to be inconsistent with the use of Form 12b-25 . \ If the reason for the Company 's delay in filing is due to the inability of a person , other than the Company , to furnish any required opinion , report or certification , additional disclosure is required . In accordance with Rule 12b- 25(c ) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , a registrant is required to attach as an exhibit a statement signed by such person stating the specific reasons why such person is unable to furnish the required opinion , report or certification on or before the date such report must be filed . \ Form 12b-25 requires the Company to provide in " reasonable detail the reasons why the Forms could not be filed within the prescribed time period ( emphasis added ) . " The Filing provided the following response , in its entirety , to
that requirement : \ The registrant requires additional time to complete the presentation of its financial statements in the Form 10-K. The registrant intends to file its Form 10- K Annual Report on or prior to the prescribed extended date . . \ Thus , it appears the Company has not completed its annual report . The Company appears to believe that the Filing and its other Form 12b-25 filings generally relieve it of its obligation to comply with General Instruction A.2(c ) of Form 10-K and General Instruction A.l(b ) of Form 10-Q ( assuming the Company is not an accelerated filer ) . We believe that such conclusion , however , is incorrect . The Company 's ongoing , long - term inability to comply with standard filing requirements certainly appears to present unresolved internal control issues . \ On the basis of the Company 's filing history , we see a continued pattern of late filings without execution of appropriate remedial action . Moreover , each explanation for the delay is vague and inadequate . We also reviewed the certifications filed by the Company as Exhibit 31 on March 22 , 2011 ( " SOX Certifications " ) with respect to the 10-Q for the period ended January 31 , 20111 . We note that paragraph 4 of the SOX Certifications relates to " disclosure controls and procedures " as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 ( e ) and 15d-15 ( e ) . The Rules define disclosure controls and procedures to be controls designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded , processed , summarized and reported , within the time periods specified in the Commission 's rules and forms . \ Based upon the reasons stated above , we do not believe the Company 's Filing provides adequate justification for the late filing . Your response to this letter should clearly outline the corrective action that you will take to remedy any and all systemic deficiencies in the Company 's disclosure controls and procedures . Your response should also discuss whether the delay was due to the inability of a person , other than the Company , to furnish any required opinion , report or certification , and , if so , the Company should file the additional disclosure noted above . \ 1 Item 4 of the 10-Q states : " As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q , an \ evaluation was performed under the supervision	that requirement : \ The registrant requires additional time to complete the presentation of its financial statements in the Form 10-K.

\ We note that you classify " Auction Rate Securities " within cash equivalents on your consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows . With respect to these securities , we understand they are long - term variable rate bonds tied to short - term interest rates that reset through a " Dutch auction ' process which typically occur every 7 - 35 days and the holder can participate in the auction and liquidate the securities to prospective buyers through a broker / dealer , but they do not have the right to put the security back to the issuer . \ Although auction rate securities are considered highly liquid by market participants because of the auction process , we believe that these securities do not meet the definition of cash equivalents in paragraphs 8 and 9 of SFAS 95 because auction rate securities have long - term maturity dates and there is no guarantee the holder will be able to liquidate its holdings . Furthermore , the staff 's view was affirmed in a October 5 , 2005 FASB Board meeting where the FASB considered whether to possibly change the above guidance and decided such action was not necessary . Therefore , auction rate securities should not be classified as a cash equivalent on your consolidated balance sheet and please refer to SFAS No . 115 to determine the proper accounting for these securities . In addition , presentation of cash flows from auction rate securities in the consolidated statements of cash flows should follow the guidance in paragraph 18 of SFAS No . 115 . \ Bridgford Foods Corporation March 6 , 2007 Page 3 \ Accordingly , please restate your consolidated financial statements in an amendment to your Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 3 , 2006 .

This language suggests that if a condition is triggered and the Company fails to assert the condition , it will not lose the right to assert the condition at a later time . Please note that when a condition is triggered and a bidder decides to proceed with the offer anyway , we believe that this decision is tantamount to a waiver of the triggered condition(s ) . Depending on the materiality of the waived condition and the number of days remaining in the offer , the Company may be required to extend the offer and recirculate new disclosure to security holders . In addition , when an offer condition is triggered by events that occur during the offer period and before the expiration of the offer , the Company should inform holders how it intends to proceed promptly , rather than waiting until the end of the offer period , unless the condition is one where satisfaction of the condition may be determined only upon expiration . Please confirm the Company 's understanding on both points in your response letter .
