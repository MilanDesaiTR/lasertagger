<LF> <LF> 1 . We note that with respect to each issuing entity that you are providing servicer <LF> assessments from multiple servicers . However , it is unclear why certain exhibits have <LF> been filed and why some have not . For instance : <LF> <LF>  We note that both CoreLogic Commercial Real Estate Services , Inc. and National <LF> Tax Search , LLC served as vendors for Wells Fargo Bank , N.A. , as master <LF> servicer . With a view towards disclosure , please explain why you filed reports on <LF> assessment of compliance with servicing criteria for these vendors , in particular . <LF> We note that Wells Fargo Bank , N.A. has taken responsibility for assessing <LF> compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to other vendors . <LF> <LF>  For WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C8 , we note that two loans are <LF> serviced under the servicing criteria of a pooling and servicing agreement that is <LF> not incorporated by reference into that issuing entity ’s form 10-K. With a view <LF> towards disclosure , please explain why these two loans are being serviced under a <LF> different pooling and servicing agreement and why this pooling and servicing <LF> agreement is not incorporated by reference in the WFRBS Commercial Mortgage <LF> Trust 2012-C8 form 10-K. <LF> <LF>  With a view towards disclosure , please explain why identical reports on <LF> assessment of compliance with servicing criteria were filed as separate exhibits . <LF> For example , in WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C8 , exhibits 33.11 , <LF> 33.14 and 33.15 filed by Wells Fargo Bank , N.A. as master servicer are identical <LF> and the latter exhibits provide investors with no new information , even though <LF> they are labeled differently in the Form 10-K. In your response , please address all <LF> duplicative filings in each of the issuing entities and not just the example noted <LF> above . <LF> <LF> While we note the Forms 10-K reference schedules to your pooling and servicing <LF> agreement , it remains unclear to us why certain servicer assessments have not been filed <LF> and some have not . In order to understand why you are providing each assessment to <LF> meet your requirements under Items 1122 and 1123 of Regulation AB and Exchange Act <LF> Rule 15d-18 your Form 10-K should include explanatory language .

( the " Company " ) <LF> <LF> File Number : 814 - 701 ( CIK 1308569 ) <LF> <LF> Dear Mr. Queen : <LF> <LF> We have reviewed the Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 filed <LF> on July 27 , 2011 ( the " Filing " ) on behalf of the Company relating to the <LF> Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30 , 2011 . We also reviewed the <LF> Form 10-K filed on August 13 , 2010 ( the " 10-K " ) and certain information <LF> presented on the Company 's website . <LF> <LF> The staff notes that since July 29 , 2008 , the Company has filed nine <LF> ( 9 ) NT filings in connection with late filing of its required statutory financial <LF> statement reports . Substantially identical justification was provided with <LF> each NT form filed by the Company . In the interest of brevity , we have <LF> omitted the full cites and descriptions of those NT filings . <LF> <LF> Based on our review of the Filing , and in conjunction with the <LF> Company 's filing history and its website , we have the following comments : <LF> <LF> 1 . We have evaluated your response to Part III in the Filing and have <LF> found your reasons for the extension of time to be inconsistent with the use <LF> of Form 12b-25 . <LF> <LF> If the reason for the Company 's delay in filing is due to the inability of <LF> a person , other than the Company , to furnish any required opinion , report or <LF> certification , additional disclosure is required .

" The Filing provided the following response , in its <LF> entirety , to that requirement : <LF> <LF> The registrant requires additional time to complete the presentation of its <LF> financial statements in the Form 10-K. The registrant intends to file its Form 10- <LF> K Annual Report on or prior to the prescribed extended date . . <LF> <LF> Thus , it appears the Company has not completed its annual report	UNITED STATES <LF> SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION <LF> <LF> WASHINGTON , D.C.20S49 <LF> <LF> DIVISION OF <LF> <LF> INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT August 4 , 2011 <LF> <LF> Michael D.

( the " Company " ) <LF> <LF> File Number : 814 - 701 ( CIK 1308569 ) <LF> <LF> Dear Mr. Queen : <LF> <LF> We have reviewed the Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 filed <LF> on July 27 , 2011 ( the " Filing " ) on behalf of the Company relating to the <LF> Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30 , 2011 . We also reviewed the <LF> Form 10-K filed on August 13 , 2010 ( the " 10-K " ) and certain information <LF> presented on the Company 's website . <LF> <LF> The staff notes that since July 29 , 2008 , the Company has filed nine <LF> ( 9 ) NT filings in connection with late filing of its required statutory financial <LF> statement reports . Substantially identical justification was provided with <LF> each NT form filed by the Company . In the interest of brevity , we have <LF> omitted the full cites and descriptions of those NT filings . <LF> <LF> Based on our review of the Filing , and in conjunction with the <LF> Company 's filing history and its website , we have the following comments : <LF> <LF> <::::> 1 . We have evaluated your response to Part III in the Filing and have <LF> found your reasons for the extension of time to be inconsistent with the use <LF> of Form 12b-25 . <LF> <LF> If the reason for the Company 's delay in filing is due to the inability of <LF> a person , other than the Company , to furnish any required opinion , report or <LF> certification , additional disclosure is required . In accordance with Rule 12b- <LF> 25(c ) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , a registrant is required to <LF> attach as an exhibit a statement signed by such person stating the specific <LF> reasons why such person is unable to furnish the required opinion , report or <LF> certification on or before the date such report must be filed . <LF> <LF> Form 12b-25 requires the Company to provide in " reasonable detail <LF> the reasons why the Forms could not be filed within the prescribed time <LF> period ( emphasis added ) . " The Filing provided the following response , in its <LF> entirety , to that requirement : <LF> <LF> The registrant requires additional time to complete the presentation of its <LF> financial statements in the Form 10-K. The registrant intends to file its Form 10- <LF> K Annual Report on or prior to the prescribed extended date . . <LF> <LF> Thus , it appears the Company has not completed its annual report
. <LF> The Company appears to believe that the Filing and its other Form 12b-25 <LF> filings generally relieve it of its obligation to comply with General Instruction <LF> A.2(c ) of Form 10-K and General Instruction A.l(b ) of Form 10-Q ( assuming <LF> the Company is not an accelerated filer ) . We believe that such conclusion , <LF> however , is incorrect . The Company 's ongoing , long - term inability to comply <LF> with standard filing requirements certainly appears to present unresolved <LF> internal control issues . <LF> <LF> On the basis of the Company 's filing history , we see a continued <LF> pattern of late filings without execution of appropriate remedial action . <LF> Moreover , each explanation for the delay is vague and inadequate . We also <LF> reviewed the certifications filed by the Company as Exhibit 31 on March 22 , <LF> 2011 ( " SOX Certifications " ) with respect to the 10-Q for the period ended <LF> January 31 , 20111 . We note that paragraph 4 of the SOX Certifications <LF> relates to " disclosure controls and procedures " as defined in Exchange Act <LF> Rules 13a-15 ( e ) and 15d-15 ( e ) . The Rules define disclosure controls and <LF> procedures to be controls designed to ensure that information required to be <LF> disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the <LF> Exchange Act is recorded , processed , summarized and reported , within the <LF> time periods specified in the Commission 's rules and forms . <LF> <LF> Based upon the reasons stated above , we do not believe the <LF> Company 's Filing provides adequate justification for the late filing . Your <LF> response to this letter should clearly outline the corrective action that you <LF> will take to remedy any and all systemic deficiencies in the Company 's <LF> disclosure controls and procedures . Your response should also discuss <LF> whether the delay was due to the inability of a person , other than the <LF> Company , to furnish any required opinion , report or certification , and , if so , <LF> the Company should file the additional disclosure noted above . <LF> <LF> 1 Item 4 of the 10-Q states : " As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q , an <LF> <LF> evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our Company 's principal executive <LF> officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Company 's disclosure <LF> controls and procedures ( as defined in Rules 13a-15(e ) and 15d-15(e ) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ) . <LF> Based on that evaluation , our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have determined that our <LF> disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report Form <LF> 1Q - Q. " <LF> <LF>	. <LF> The Company appears to believe that the Filing and its other Form 12b-25 <LF> filings generally relieve it of its obligation to comply with General Instruction <LF> A.2(c ) of Form 10-K and General Instruction A.l(b ) of Form 10-Q ( assuming <LF> the Company is not an accelerated filer ) . We believe that such conclusion , <LF> however , is incorrect . The Company 's ongoing , long - term inability to comply <LF> with standard filing requirements certainly appears to present unresolved <LF> internal control issues . <LF> <LF> On the basis of the Company 's filing history , we see a continued <LF> pattern of late filings without execution of appropriate remedial action . <LF> Moreover , each explanation for the delay is vague and inadequate . We also <LF> reviewed the certifications filed by the Company as Exhibit 31 on March 22 , <LF> 2011 ( " SOX Certifications " ) with respect to the 10-Q for the period ended <LF> January 31 , 20111 . We note that paragraph 4 of the SOX Certifications <LF> relates to " disclosure controls and procedures " as defined in Exchange Act <LF> Rules 13a-15 ( e ) and 15d-15 ( e ) . The Rules define disclosure controls and <LF> procedures to be controls designed to ensure that information required to be <LF> disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the <LF> Exchange Act is recorded , processed , summarized and reported , within the <LF> time periods specified in the Commission 's rules and forms . <LF> <LF> Based upon the reasons stated above , we do not believe the <LF> Company 's Filing provides adequate justification for the late filing . Your <LF> response to this letter should clearly outline the corrective action that you <LF> will take to remedy any and all systemic deficiencies in the Company 's <LF> disclosure controls and procedures . Your response should also discuss <LF> whether the delay was due to the inability of a person , other than the <LF> Company , to furnish any required opinion , report or certification , and , if so , <LF> the Company should file the additional disclosure noted above . <LF> <LF> 1 Item 4 of the 10-Q states : " As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q , an <LF> <LF> evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our Company 's principal executive <LF> officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Company 's disclosure <LF> controls and procedures ( as defined in Rules 13a-15(e ) and 15d-15(e ) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ) . <LF> Based on that evaluation , our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have determined that our <LF> disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report Form <LF> 1Q - Q.

On the Company 's website ( www.unicapman.com ) . we located the <LF> following disclosure . <LF> <LF> Shareholder value is primarily derived by two factors including its net asset <LF> value per share and its trading multiple to net asset value . The Company 's net <LF> asset value is determined by adding the portfolio company values plus its cash <LF> and cash equivalents minus its liabilities . ( subtracting total Liabilities from total <LF> Assets ) This formula equals Net Asset Value . The division of the Company 's Net <LF> Asset Value by its number of outstanding shares equals its Net Asset Value per <LF> share . <LF> <LF> While a trading multiple is effected by many conditions , similar companies over <LF> the last three years have shown an average multiple of 2.82 times Net asset <LF> Value per share . While this is an average , one must understand that prior <LF> performance is not necessarily indicative of future results . <LF> <LF> Moreover , Universal Capital Management 's policy of dividending shares of <LF> specific portfolio companies to its shareholders when appropriate , is an added <LF> incentive to potential investors . <LF> <LF> As a result of this policy , Universal Capital Management expects to remain at or <LF> exceed the industry 's average trading multiple . <LF> <LF> We believe this disclosure is misleading . Please explain in <LF> your response letter the applicability of a 2.82 multiple of net asset <LF> value ( " NAV " ) , and include identification of all business development <LF> companies with a multiple of NAV equal to or greater than 2.82 and <LF> used to define the " industry 's average trading multiple " . Please <LF> reference the independent source that defines this industry and <LF> calculates such multiples , or explain to the staff how and why such <LF> calculation was made , and by whom . <LF> <LF> We understand this presentation to mean BDCs trading at <LF> 2820/0 of their NAVs . We believe that the Company has little or no <LF> control over the premium , if any , at which its stock trades on the <LF> market . Any attempt to assure shareholders that its stock will trade <LF> at such large premiums or that there is an independent industry <LF> average trading multiple is misleading or might potentially give rise <LF> to some form of market manipulation . If needed , the Company <LF> should make prominent and immediate corrective disclosure using <LF> Form 8-K and it should revise its website accordingly . <LF> <LF> 3 . In addition , the NAV reconciliation in the Company 's financial <LF> <LF> highlights in the 10-K does not appear to identify any dividends paid <LF> over the last few years . Please explain this and provide a cross <LF> <LF> reference to the Company 's written " policy of dividending shares of <LF> <LF> 3 <LF> <LF> specific portfolio companies to its shareholders "	2 <LF> <LF> <::::> 2 .

<LF> <LF> The Fund will invest indirectly in litigation purchase proceeds contracts ( “ contracts ” ) .

Please <LF> provide the staff with your legal analysis of why the Fund ’s investment and the contracts meet <LF> the definition of a security under the securities laws , how the Fund meets the definition of an <LF> investment company under section 3 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 ( " 1940 Act")and <LF> why the SPE is not an investment company under the Act .

In addition , please explain why the <LF> offering should not be considered an offering of the SPE ’s securities , requiring , among other <LF> things , management of the SPE to sign the registration statement .
